## Project Description
This is a secure authentication system built for the Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform.
It handles user registration and login using secure password hashing to protect user data.

## Features
- Secure Password Hashing (using bcrypt)
- User Registration (saves to users.txt)
- User Login (verifies credentials)
- Input Validation (checks for strong passwords)

## AI Assistance Disclosure
*Transparency Statement*
I utilized AI assistance (ChatGPT/DeepSeek) to help explain Python file handling, debug errors in my VS Code/PyCharm setup, and understand the logic behind bcrypt hashing. All code logic regarding the lab requirements was reviewed and implemented based on my own understanding of the Week 7 lectures.
